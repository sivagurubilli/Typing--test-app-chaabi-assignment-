# Typing--test-app-chaabi-assignment-
This repository contains the source code for a typing speed testing application. 
The app was created as an assignment project and is designed to test and improve the user's typing speed. 
The user is presented with a passage to type and the app measures the time taken to type the entire passage, 
calculates the typing speed in words per minute, and displays the result. The app also keeps track of the user's progress over time,
so the user can see how their typing speed improves with practice.
